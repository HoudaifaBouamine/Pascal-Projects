Project Two: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Firstly, you should assume that you are in the first project (ATM) + you've seen my solution + you should solve the first project again by dividing it into functions & procedures with readable names and variables with meaningful names.

When the program starts, it asks you to enter a number representing the number of rounds in the game. The number should be between 1 and 10; otherwise, the user is prompted again.

After choosing the number of rounds, the player is given three options:

1)  Rock
2)  Paper
3)  Scissors

The player makes a choice by entering the corresponding number (between 1 and 3).

After the player's choice, the computer randomly selects behind the scenes, determining the winner for that round. The player's choice and the computer's choice are displayed on the screen, along with the name of the winner or a tie if the options are the same.

The next round then begins, identical to the first.

At the end of the last round, a summary of the game is displayed:

    Number of rounds won by the player
    Number of rounds won by the computer
    Number of tied rounds
    The ultimate winner

The player is then asked if they want to play again:

    Entering 'Y' agrees to play again, and the game restarts from the beginning (from the stage of choosing the number of rounds), making the new game independent of the previous one.
    Entering 'N' in response to the replay question ends the program.

Please try the program (without reading the code) for a better understanding of the requirements.
