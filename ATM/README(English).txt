Small Project in Pascal Language

Note: Do not read the code.

Copy and paste the code you have and run the program to see the output.

By doing so, you will understand how the program works.

Then, write code that produces a similar or close result to this program (without reading my code!).

To continue, write the project on your own.

Finally, you can read the code.

Look at the method I used and understand it. Afterward, write the code in your own way.

This method will help you deal with larger projects in the future.

Now, let's briefly explain the idea.

The program is a simulation of an ATM (Automatic Teller Machine). "Assume" that you insert the debit card into the machine, and it asks for the password.

The password in this simple program will be only one, which is 1234 (in your program, you can use any password you like). If you don't enter the correct password, it will tell you it's incorrect and ask again.

When you enter, it will show you 4 options: deposit money, withdraw money, check your balance, and exit the program.

Choose what to do by entering the number next to the option.

Follow the instructions in the program and try several experiments until you understand how it works before you start programming.
